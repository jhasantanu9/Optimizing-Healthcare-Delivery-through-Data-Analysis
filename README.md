# Optimizing-Healthcare-Delivery-through-Data-Analytics
This project delivers key insights into patient trends, hospital stays, and costs at Massachusetts General Hospital. Through data visualization, we explore admissions, readmissions, average costs, and insurance coverage to inform and optimize healthcare delivery and financial performance.

###Project Description:

Goals: The primary goals of this project were to analyze patient trends, hospital stay durations, and financial metrics at Massachusetts General Hospital. By leveraging data visualization and analysis, we aimed to provide actionable insights that could improve patient care, optimize hospital operations, and enhance financial performance.
Business Needs: Massachusetts General Hospital needed a comprehensive understanding of:
Patient admissions and readmission rates over time.
The average duration of patient hospital stays.
Average cost per patient visit.
Insurance coverage for various procedures.
Addressing these needs would enable hospital executives to make informed decisions, improve resource allocation, and enhance patient care.
Discovery and Presentation of Insights:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Downloaded the data provided - Synthetic data on ~1k patients of Massachusetts General Hospital from 2011-2022, including information on patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters & procedures.
Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, based on the provided data dictionary in Excel.
2. Data Analysis:
Patient Admissions and Readmissions:
Analyzed the total number of patients admitted and readmitted over time using unique patient IDs and encounter dates.
Created calculated fields to distinguish between first-time visits and revisits.
Hospital Stay Durations:
Calculated the average length of hospital stays using the start and stop dates of encounters and procedures.
Converted the length of stay into hours and minutes for more granular insights.
Cost Analysis:
Calculated the average cost per visit by aggregating cost data from patient encounters and the cost of procedures.
Insurance Coverage:
Analyzed the number and percentage of procedures covered by insurance using the payer information.
Analyzed average cost covered by insurance (Payers).
3. Visualization and Interpretation:
Utilized Tableau to create interactive dashboards displaying key performance indicators (KPIs).
Total Encounters:
Developed a chart showing total encounters for the selected year versus the previous year.
Created a dynamic title that updates based on the selected year.
Patient Visit Trends:
Created a visualization to show patient visit trends.
Single-visited patients and readmitted patients and evaluated the readmission rate.
Used bins to categorize visit times into 3-hour intervals.
Average Hospital Stay Duration:
Plotted the average length of stay for encounters and procedures to highlight variations over time.
Cost Per Visit:
Developed a chart to show the trend in average cost per visit.
Insurance Coverage:
Created a chart to display the percentage distribution of procedures covered by insurance versus those not covered.
4. Enhancing the Visualization:
Added annotations to charts to explain key insights and highlight important data points.
Used colors to differentiate between various categories and enhance visual appeal.
Filtered data dynamically based on selected parameters to provide customized views for executives.
Ensured the ability to navigate between different dashboards based on parameter selections.
5. Presentation of Insights:
Summarized findings in a professional presentation tailored for the executive team.
Highlighted trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement.
Provided recommendations based on data-driven insights.
Key Insights:
Identified peak hours for patient visits, helping in resource allocation and staffing.
Highlighted patient admissions and readmissions trends, enabling better hospital capacity management.
They analyzed cost per visit to identify potential areas for cost optimization.
Assessed insurance coverage to understand the financial impact on the hospital and patients.
Conclusion: This comprehensive approach enabled Massachusetts General Hospital to gain valuable insights into patient care trends and financial performance, facilitating better decision-making and optimized healthcare delivery. The project provided a robust foundation for ongoing data analysis and informed strategic planning.
